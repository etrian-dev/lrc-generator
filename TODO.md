### TODO
* Fix preview mode: thread does not sleep long enough
* Add lenght tag
* Fix some memory leaks, probably due to incorrect use of ncurses
* Force writing metadata at the top of the .lrc file
* Better file and options handling
* Volume controls while synchronizing
* Add logging. Maybe [this lib](https://github.com/emilk/loguru)
